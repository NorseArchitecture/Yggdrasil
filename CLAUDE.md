# CLAUDE.md — Yggdrasil (`Norse.Hosting`)

## 0. Wrong Root — Halt

If you are reading this because **Yggdrasil itself is the Claude Code session root** — someone ran `claude` from inside this directory instead of `../Bifrost` — stop here. Do not read further, do not propose changes, do not run anything.

Tell the user: every Norse Architecture session starts from **Bifrost**. Org-wide settings (the `superpowers` plugin, permission rules) only apply when Bifrost is the actual session root — Claude Code never merges a submodule's own `.claude/settings.json` into a parent-launched session. Exit, `cd ../Bifrost`, and run `claude` there instead.

This repo's own `.claude/settings.json` carries a `SessionStart` hook that should already have blocked this session before this file was ever read. If you're reading this anyway, hooks were bypassed, disabled, or failed — halt regardless; this rule does not depend on the hook to hold.

## 1. What This Repository Is

Yggdrasil is **connective tissue** — `Norse.Hosting`: the web, worker, and migration service chassis (`Norse.Hosting.Web.Server`/`.Web.Client`/`.App`/`.Worker`/`.Migrations.Service`) and the deployables built on it. It hosts the runtime endpoints that Bifrost composes but never provides itself. In the dependency chain it rides on Midgard and everything below; Himinbjorg and Heimdall ride above it.

This repo is currently a bare shell (LICENSE only) — no specs have converged here yet. Before writing any code: brainstorm → spec → plan, recorded in `../Glitnir/docs/Yggdrasil/`, per the org's spec-first discipline. Do not scaffold a project structure ahead of a converged spec. A hosting plan is already filed (`../Glitnir/docs/Yggdrasil/plans/2026-05-20-yggdrasil-hosting.md`, halted at the plan stage awaiting greenlight) — when it (or any later plan) executes, its REQUIRED SUB-SKILL line names `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` as the default (not a recommendation among equals — `executing-plans` is the narrow fallback for separate-session review checkpoints) paired with `superpowers:test-driven-development` — implementation here is subagent-orchestrated and test-driven, never one without the other (`../Glitnir/CLAUDE.md` §2.8).

See `../Bifrost/CLAUDE.md` (§2 The Naming Model) and `../Glitnir/CLAUDE.md` (§1 Bounded Context Map) for the full realm table and how Yggdrasil fits the rest of the cosmos.
